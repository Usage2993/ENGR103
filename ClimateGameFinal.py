# Author: Alexander Vogs
# Date: June 2025
# Description: This program is a text-based adventure game based on
#              climate action. The user rolls a virtual die
#              to move through a list of climate events, gaining or losing
#              points. The goal is to reach the end of the list with a 
#              positive score and without hitting a game-ending event.
# Input: Pressing enter to roll the die.
# Output: Event messages, updated scores, and win/lose game status.
